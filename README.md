Asynchronous task queue and scheduler for Python, where one task runs on exactly one worker.
</p>

<br>

## 🚀 Project

Queuefy is a task queue and a scheduler that are the same thing.

Everything it does reduces to a single row: **a run that is due, which exactly one worker claims**. An
immediate task, an interval, a fixed datetime and a cron expression differ only in *when the next run
is written*, and in nothing else.

That is why there is no separate scheduler process, no broker and no leader election. Start it on ten
machines and the nightly report still runs once.

## ✨ Features

- [x] Run a task now, off the request that asked for it
- [x] Run a task every N seconds
- [x] Run a task once, at a stated date and time
- [x] Run a task on a cron expression
- [x] One run on exactly one worker, however many processes, workers and machines
- [x] Retries with fixed, linear, exponential and jittered policies
- [x] Timeouts, heartbeats and recovery of what a dead worker was holding
- [x] Named queues and priorities
- [x] Lifecycle hooks for auditing, metrics and alerting
- [x] Pluggable stores: PostgreSQL 14+, MySQL 8.0+, Redis 7+, SQLite and memory
- [x] Survives a kill: what a dead worker held comes back, and a schedule resumes where it stopped
- [x] No dependencies in the core
- [x] 100% branch coverage: one contract against every store, plus multi-worker, multi-machine, everyday, disaster and interrupted-call suites

## 📦 Install

```bash
pip install "queuefy[sqlalchemy]"
```

Or with Redis:

```bash
pip install "queuefy[redis]"
```

## 🧭 The four ways to ask for work

| What you want | How you ask for it |
| --- | --- |
| run it now | `await app.enqueue("send_email", to="a@b.com")` |
| run it every 30 seconds | `@app.task("poll", every=30)` |
| run it once, at a stated time | `await app.enqueue_at("report", when)` |
| run it on a cron expression | `@app.task("nightly", cron="0 4 * * *")` |

## 💡 How to use

```python
import asyncio

from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine

from queuefy.app import Queuefy
from queuefy.store.sqlalchemy import SqlAlchemyStore
from queuefy.worker import Worker

app = Queuefy(SqlAlchemyStore(create_async_engine("sqlite+aiosqlite:///app.db")))


@app.task("send_email", max_attempts=5, timeout=30)
async def send_email(to: str, subject: str):
    ...


@app.task("nightly_report", cron="0 4 * * *")
async def nightly_report():
    ...


async def main():
    await app.setup()
    await app.enqueue("send_email", to="reader@example.com", subject="Welcome")
    await Worker(app, concurrency=8).run()


asyncio.run(main())
```

## 🧱 The words it uses

Three of them, and each means one thing:

| Word | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **Task** | what you declare: a name, the code, and the policy it runs under |
| **Run** | one execution of a task, which is the only thing a worker ever claims |
| **Queue** | a named lane a task belongs to, and a worker serves |

## 🏷️ Releasing a new version

A release is a tag and nothing else. Bump `project.version` in `pyproject.toml`, commit it, then push
the matching tag:

```bash
git tag v1.0.4
git push origin v1.0.4
```

That tag is the only trigger. The workflow then runs the suite on every supported Python and against
the oldest supported version of each store, runs the stress suite against real servers, checks that
the tag agrees with `pyproject.toml`, builds the wheel and the sdist, publishes them to PyPI through
Trusted Publishing, and creates the GitHub release with its notes and the built files attached.

> **Do not publish the release from the GitHub interface.** Creating one there writes the tag, the tag
> starts the workflow, and the workflow then finds a release already sitting where it was going to
> write its own — so the run ends red at the last step with the package already on PyPI. Push the tag
> and let the workflow create the release, which is also how the built files come to be attached to it.

> **A version on PyPI is permanent.** A tag that disagrees with `project.version` is refused before
> anything is built, because a number published by mistake is one PyPI never lets anybody use again.
